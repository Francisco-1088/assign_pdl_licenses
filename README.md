# assign_pdl_licenses
Simple script to assign large quantities of equal licenses to large quantities of equal devices. Script allows selection of device type you wish to assign licenses from your available pool. As of today, the script does not differentiate between different duration licenses, nor different license tiers within a type of license (i.e. MX65-ENT is treated the same as MX65-SEC).

Modify the credentials.py file to include your API Key and your target organization's org_id.
